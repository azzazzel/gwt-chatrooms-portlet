 * The implementation of the message local service.

 * All custom service methods should be put in this class. Whenever methods are added, rerun ServiceBuilder to copy their definitions into the {@link com.commsen.sample.portlet.chatrooms.service.MessageLocalService} interface.

 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. Always use {@link com.commsen.sample.portlet.chatrooms.service.MessageLocalServiceUtil} to access the message local service.

 *
 * <p>
 * This is a local service. Methods of this service will not have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can only be accessed from within the same VM.
